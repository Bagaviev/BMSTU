# Stock_WEB
Thats my master`s work. Stock exchange website. Some indicators via pandas/matplotlib/ta with static image rendering on flask. Without any DB, some data and pics stored on disk. 
First steps in web dev and flask thought.
Considered to do with no entuziasm or help from teachers side.
BTW this can be sheduled by cron/win sheduler and posted some where, and maybe it will work (update data automatically).
